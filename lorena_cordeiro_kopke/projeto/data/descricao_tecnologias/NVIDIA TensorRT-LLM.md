resumo: otimização de inferência de LLMs.


Overview
About TensorRT LLM
TensorRT LLM is NVIDIA’s comprehensive open-source library for accelerating and optimizing inference performance of the latest large language models (LLMs) on NVIDIA GPUs.

Key Capabilities
🔥 Architected on Pytorch
TensorRT LLM provides a high-level Python LLM API that supports a wide range of inference setups - from single-GPU to multi-GPU or multi-node deployments. It includes built-in support for various parallelism strategies and advanced features. The LLM API integrates seamlessly with the broader inference ecosystem, including NVIDIA Dynamo and the Triton Inference Server.

TensorRT LLM is designed to be modular and easy to modify. Its PyTorch-native architecture allows developers to experiment with the runtime or extend functionality. Several popular models are also pre-defined and can be customized using native PyTorch code, making it easy to adapt the system to specific needs.
